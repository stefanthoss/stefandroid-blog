For backups or storage of your personal data on a removable USB drive you should encrypt the drive so that nobody except for yourself can access that data. This is especially important for removable drives because they can more easily get lost or stolen. In this guide I use Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) for the disk encryption. This is supported by pretty much any modern Linux system so it's easy to take your drive to a different computer and access the encrypted data.
