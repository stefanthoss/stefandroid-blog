[Scrutiny](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny) is a tool that collects SMART hard drive data and exposes them
through a web UI. You can run a central Docker container that contains the database/UI and install the data collection
agent on multiple clients. This will provide a single interface to monitor all hard drives in all servers.

## Web UI

## Collector on Debian Bullseye

## Collector on TrueNAS
