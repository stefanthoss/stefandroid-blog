This is Stefan's tech blog - focussing on self-hosting, home networking, and Linux.

I built my blog using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)
theme. It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and deployed with
[helaili/jekyll-action](https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action).
