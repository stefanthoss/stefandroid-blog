Welcome to my personal tech blog! I'm Stefan and I'm passionate about self-hosting, home automation, privacy, and building homelabs. On this blog, I will share my experiences and knowledge on these topics, as well as offer tips and tutorials for those who want to solve similar problems.

Self-hosting, for those who may not be familiar, refers to hosting your own websites, applications, and services on your own hardware, rather than relying on third-party providers (like the _cloud_). This allows you to have full control over your data and infrastructure, and can be a great way to save money and improve security and privacy.

I am also a big believer in the power of homelabs. Building a homelab allows you to experiment, learn, and develop your skills in a safe and controlled environment. I will share my own journey of building a homelab and offer advice for others who are interested in doing the same. Feel free to leave comments and feedback!

I built my blog using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)
theme. It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and deployed with
[helaili/jekyll-action](https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action). The comment sections are powered by self-hosted
[Remark42](https://remark42.com).

## Electronic Frontier Foundation

I support the [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/), a non-profit organization that fights for digital rights and that the Internet remains a place where freedom of expression, privacy, and innovation are respected and protected. They provide valuable resources and support individuals and organizations who care about digital rights. Supporting the EFF is a great way to help protect your own rights and contribute to a more open, free, and secure Internet.
