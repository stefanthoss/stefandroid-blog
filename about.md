Welcome to my personal tech blog! I'm Stefan and I'm passionate about self-hosting, home automation, privacy, and
building my homelab. On this blog, I will share my experiences and knowledge, as well as offer tips and
tutorials for those who want to solve similar problems as me.

I built my blog using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)
theme. It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and deployed with
[helaili/jekyll-action](https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action). The comment sections are powered by self-hosted
[Remark42](https://remark42.com).
